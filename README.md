# Death Restart
A PaperMC plugin created for [@Syndicate](https://twitter.com/Syndicate) and his new Minecraft series.

## Description
When a player dies all players on the server will be stopped in their tracks. A death screen (pumpkin head) will be
applied to all players and they will not be allowed to move. After 20 seconds the server will restart and the world will
have been deleted. If you wish to have the same world generate make sure you specify the seed in the `server.properties`
file
